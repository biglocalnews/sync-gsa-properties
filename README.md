# About this
This is a project to take the U.S. General Services Administration's records of leases and owned properties, see what's new, and send new files to Big Local News.

For more information, see the [notebook file that contains the code](https://github.com/biglocalnews/sync-gsa-properties/blob/master/sync-gsa-properties.ipynb).
